# What to Wear?

It's just for fun! Let's build a multi-agent system that can advise you on what to wear based on various factors like weather, location, fashion trends, and even designer-level insights. We can include the following agents in the system:

- Weather Agent: This agent retrieves weather information for your location and date, offering suggestions on what to wear. It can also select appropriate clothing from a provided list.

- Location Agent: This agent advises you on what types of clothing to wear based on your location. It helps you decide whether to dress like the locals or choose something that sets you apart.

- Fashion Agent: This agent analyzes current fashion trends and assigns a fashion score to each clothing option.

- Designer Agent: This agent offers personalized advice based on your preferences and professional design expertise. You can share your likes, dislikes, and preferred styles, and it will guide you accordingly.
